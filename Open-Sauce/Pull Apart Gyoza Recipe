1.To make the dough, combine flour, baking powder, salt and sugar in a bowl. Add in milk and vegetable oil and knead until soft and pliable. Cover with plastic wrap and let is sit at room temperature for 1 hour.
2. Combine cabbage, chives, green onions, ginger, garlic, salt and pepper in a separate bowl. Mix until ingredients are evenly combined. Set aside.
3. Put the ground pork into a new bowl and knead until meat becomes sticky. Add in the soy sauce, Chinese soup base and sugar and mix well. Add the vegetable mixture and mix until well combined.
4. Roll out the dough into a circle, about 12 inches in diameter. Transfer the gyoza filling onto the center of the dough. Wrap the dough around the filling and flip it over so the smooth side is facing up. 
Shape the dough the size of your frying pan. Make 12 slits from the outside to the center, leaving 2 inches of the center intact. Carefully transfer to a frying pan and twist the ends of the dough. Cook on medium heat for 1 minute. Pour hot water around the dough. 
Cover and cook on low heat for another 20 minutes. Take the cover off and increase to medium heat. Pour sesame oil around the sides of the gyoza bun and continue cooking until fragrant.
5. Tear off with hands and enjoy with condiments of your choice.
