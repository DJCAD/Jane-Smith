My name is Jane Smith â€“ I graduated from Interior and Environmental Design therefore I always take a special care of the environmental factory of the design. 
As well as gain the knowledge of be able to use adobe softwares, 3D modelling softwares, physical workshop experiences and a good understanding of basic concepts of drawing. 
Please assess me on my ability to tell stories through hands on drawing, contextual images generate from computer software and physical making of the prototype, 
also the ability to take a step back and look at the bigger picture with needed research skill 
as i'm very new to code and thinking with Arduino in mind when making physical prototype therefore is not my strongest ability yet.
