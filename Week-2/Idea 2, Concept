My idea is two connected interactive lamps (name yet to be decide) which locates in different parts of the world, by interact with one of the lamp, automatically send a signal to the connected other lamp across the world. 
A communication interactive tool for the global family and friends, communicating through colours, movements or even noises, use your other senses like touch, smell, hear and more to aim for a more emotional design. 
There are a few different directions I can go with this project, as it's very personal I would take a more personal approach as to the details of the product relating back to my own family and friends.
but after speak to a few PHD students, design professors and some further research I feel this isn't just a personal issue anymore, more and more people experience similar situation, especially in the order age group where they craving for this closeness intimacy but find it hard to use the technology appointed. 
Tackle the social issue of loneliness in this heavy dose of technology era
