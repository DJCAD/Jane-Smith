Week one during the 10th to the 14th of October 2016 
week started really intense, slowly getting a better understanding of the course and hardware in use, at the end was rather rewarding.
Developed 10 IoT concepts within connected homes
Idea 2 - interactive long distance lamp (name yet to decide) was the one concept where I felt most connected
In the next three week, aim to develop idea 2 into a final working product, through more celever prototypes and generate more feedbacks
